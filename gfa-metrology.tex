\title{DESI GFA metrology to on-sky pixel conversions}

\maketitle

The DESI GFAs underwent metrology at Berkeley Lab, using a setup that
allowed a dot to be projected onto the GFA CCD, which could then be
measured in physical coordinates and also observed by reading out the
GFA CCDs.  This allows the GFA pixel grid to be tied to a physical
coordinate system in which the GFA Illuminated Fiducials (GIFs) are
also measured.

This document interprets the lab report measurements in terms of the
way the GFA images are read out in operations on the mountain, in
support of predicting the on-sky positions of the GFAs, GIFs, and (via
FVC images) the other fiducials and fibers.

The GFA metrology procedure is documented in DESI-4782.  The resulting
measurements are presented with one document per GFA device, as
detailed in Table \ref{tab:gfareports}.  This table is listed in Petal
location order, looked up via DESI-5286v5.

\section{GFA Metrology}

In each GFA metrology report, there is a spreadsheet named
``GFA\#\#\_Lateral\_Measurements.xlsx'', plus a set of FITS images as a
zip file.  In the spreadsheet, the ``GFA Images'' tab has the spot
location measurements in millimeters, and GFA image filenames.  The
measured positions are only good to ~the nearest pixel, so we will
re-measure them with code.

The GFA images are FITS files with 4 image extensions, each $1106
\times 1056$ pixels.  NOTE that the FITS viewer \code{ds9} may not
show you the whole image by default---it may show only the active CCD
area, omitting the prescan and overscan columns, and the extra rows.
See Figure \ref{fig:metrologya}.  The extent of one-quarter of
the physical CCD area ($1024 \times 1032$) is shown.

    (with the same order as the FITS file extensions) in the GFA

    spots are given in a combined coordinate system in the arrangement
    shown, with $(0,0)$ in the lower left. The axes mark the origin
    and direction of the pixels in each image.  Right: pixel layout
    within each FITS image.}
\end{figure}

On the mountain, the GFAs have a mask installed so that only the
central part of each CCD is illuminated, with the remaining chip area
used for frame transfer.  The \code{gfa*.fits.fz} files $2248 \times
1032$, with $50$-pixel prescan and overscan columns, leaving an
illuminated area of $2048 \times 1032$, as illustrated in Figure
\ref{fig:mountain}.  The lab and mountain coordinate systems are shown
in Figure \ref{fig:spots}.

    system and in GFA CCD coordinates as read out on the mountain.}
\end{figure}

In the notebook \code{gfa-metrology.ipynb}, we copy-paste the results
cells from each of the GFA metrology reports, and also extract the
images, then go through each image and detect and measure the spot
location to sub-pixel accuracy, by fitting a 2-d Gaussian profile (and
masking saturated pixels).  We transform these measurements to
coordinates that match the spreadsheet coordinate system, and also
transform to match the mountain coordinate system.  We then fit a
linear transformation from the mountain pixel coordinate system (in
FITS-indexed pixels), to millimeters.

Finally, we copy-paste the GIF measured pinhole locations, and apply
the transformation to report those positions in GFA pixel positions.

\paragraph{Output files}

The \code{data/gfa-metrology-transform.fits} file contains columns:
\begin{itemize}
\item{gfa\_num} GFA\#x identifier
\item{pix\_x\_coeffs, pix\_y\_coeffs} millimeters-to-mountain-pixel x and y transformations, as (offset, x, y).
  That is, to convert local GFA metrology mm to pixels, \code{pix\_x = pix\_x\_coeffs[0] + pix\_x\_coeffs[1]*mm\_x + pix\_x\_coeffs[2]*mm\_y}
\item{mm\_x\_coeffs, mm\_y\_coeffs} mountain-pixels-to-millimeters x and y transformations, as (offset, x, y).
\item{gif\_1\_mm\_x, gif\_1\_mm\_y} GIF 1, millimeter coordinates
\item{gif\_2\_mm\_x, gif\_2\_mm\_y} GIF 2, millimeter coordinates
\item{gif\_1\_pix\_x, gif\_1\_pix\_y} GIF 1, millimeter coordinates transformed
  into mountain pixel coordinates.
\item{gif\_1\_pix\_x, gif\_1\_pix\_y} GIF 2, millimeter coordinates transformed
  into mountain pixel coordinates.
\end{itemize}


\paragraph{Notes}

Some of the spreadsheet filenames end in \code{.fit} while the actual
filenames are \code{.fits}.

GFA\#2 has a transcription error in one of the spot positions: the
spreadsheet contains $1548$, but the measured position is $\sim 1458$.

GFA\#4 \emph{was} missing file \code{IMG\_30.fits} in version
DESI-4822-v2; it exists in DESI-4822-v3.

In GFA\#4, the GIF2 measurements are only for 3 of the pinholes;
pinholes 1 and 3 are duplicates (re-measurements of the same hole).

The spots are saturated in some images.  In the notebook, we handle this correctly, by masking the central pixels
when performing the Gaussian spot fit.


\paragraph{GIF spot locations} are reported in Table \ref{tab:pinholes},
for completeness.

\section{GFA/GIF Metrology}

DESI-5141-v6 contains metrology results of the fiducials, in JSON
format.  These are more up-to-date than the original Excel petal
metrology reports, such as DESI-4900.

Here, we will assume that the GFA CCD and the GIFs are at the same
offset relative to the focal plane.  We will therefore ignore the $z$
component of the CCD, and just work in projected $x,y$ coordinates,
assuming that the GFA module is mounted parallel to the focal plane.
DESI-5331 shows that this is reasonable.

In the notebook \code{gif-fif.ipynb} (and \code{petal-metrology.py}
module and \code{gif-fif.py} driver), we fit for a rigid
transformation (with scaling) between the local GFA metrology
coordinate system and the petal-local coordinate system, based on the
two GIFs per petal.  The scaling is required to perform the projection
into the petal-local $x,y$ plane, because in the petal-local
coordinate system, the two GIFs differ in $z$ by about 5 mm.

This allows us to place the GFA CCD pixels in petal-local $x,y$
coordinates.

In order to take a GFA CCD image of the sky and project the RA,Dec
position of the GIFs, we must take into account the fairly strong
distortion pattern of the corrector lens at the location of the GFAs.
Using the Echo-22 focal plane parameters from DESI-0329, as recorded
in
\code{https://desi.lbl.gov/trac/browser/code/desimodel/trunk/data/focalplane/platescale.txt},
we use \code{Theta} as a function of \code{Radius} to project sky
coordinates onto the focal-plane $x,y$ plane.  We create a grid with
GFA CCD pixel locations and projected sky locations, and fit a SIP WCS
transformation.  This is required: as shown in Figure \ref{fig:sip},
the distortion is strong enough that the difference between assuming a
local tangent plane and the fit SIP transformation amounts to an error
of about 5 arcseconds when extrapolating to the positions of the GIFs.

\begin{figure}

    \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{distortion}

  \caption{Distortion due to Echo22 optics, centered on the GFA CCD.
    This must be taken into account to correctly predict the sky
    locations of the GIFs.\label{fig:sip}}
\end{figure}

The result of this fitting is a set of SIP WCS headers---polynomial
distortion maps in pixel space---that can be used to fit GFA CCD
images of the sky to reference catalogs, and predict the RA,Dec
coordinates of the GIFs.

These data files are stored in the \code{data} directory with names like
\code{sip-petal4.fits}.
